# t21_multiome

RNA + ATAC in T21 and healthy fetal liver samples

## Notes

- I made a directory "scripts" with subdirectories "scripts/andrew" and "scripts/jon"
- I also made a directory "output" that is in .gitignore so any output here will not be pushed to github (useful for generating large data & saving)
